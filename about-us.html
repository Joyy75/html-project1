        <h3>I'm <mark>Joyy</mark></h3>
        <p>
          As a dedicated DC fan, Joyy draws motivation and inspiration from the
          captivating stories and complex characters within the DC universe.
          With Peacemaker as his favorite hero, Joyy resonates deeply with the
          character's determination and resilience. Her love for DC films and
          series continually fuels her creativity and perspective on life's
          challenges.

          Beyond his passion for DC, Joyy is an avid rock music enthusiast. She
          loves the electrifying energy of rock songs and finds immense joy in
          listening to her favorite track, "Cold Blood" by Kissin' Dynamite. The
          powerful melodies and lyrics of rock music inspire Joyy to approach
          each day with renewed vigor and enthusiasm.

          In addition to her passions for DC and rock music, Joyy has a profound
          love for art, particularly the black and gray pencil style. This
          monochromatic approach allows for a remarkable depth of shading and
          contrast, bringing to life intricate details and capturing the essence
          of his subjects. Joyy finds solace and expression in creating and
          appreciating this art form, where every stroke of the pencil
          contributes to a rich tapestry of light and shadow.

            My Man Peacemaker Said "There's No Wrong Time For Rock" And I fxcking agree with him. Rock is the best genre of music ever. It's the only genre that can make you feel like you're on top of the world!
